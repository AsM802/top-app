# Implementation Tracking Document

## Project Goal
To build an App Store rank finder for Coinbase, Phantom, and Moonshot applications. The tool will scrape dynamic content from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store using Puppeteer, track rankings, and send updates via Telegram messages at 12-hour intervals.

## Current Progress

### 1. Puppeteer Integration for Scraping
- **`scraper.js`**: Modified to use Puppeteer for dynamic web page scraping. It now attempts to navigate to the app store pages for Coinbase, Phantom, and Moonshot on both iOS and Android.
- **App URLs**: Placeholder URLs for Moonshot have been added and will need to be verified/updated for accuracy.
- **Rank Extraction**: Basic logic to extract rank information from the page has been implemented. This will likely require refinement based on the actual structure of the app store pages.

### 2. Telegram Integration
- **`telegram.js`**: Created to encapsulate Telegram bot functionality. It includes a `sendTelegramMessage` function.
- **Configuration**: Requires `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to be replaced with actual values.

### 3. Scheduling and Orchestration
- **`index.js`**: Updated to use `node-cron` to schedule the `getAppRankings` function from `scraper.js` to run every 12 hours.
- **Reporting**: After scraping, the results are formatted into a message and sent via `sendTelegramMessage`.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for the scraping and Telegram sending process is in place.

## Next Steps / To-Do

1.  **Verify Moonshot URLs**: Confirm the correct Apple App Store and Google Play Store URLs for Moonshot.
2.  **Refine Rank Extraction Logic**: The current rank extraction in `scraper.js` is a preliminary attempt. It needs to be thoroughly tested and refined to accurately capture the category rank on both Apple App Store and Google Play Store pages, as these pages are dynamic and their structure might change.
3.  **Error Handling and Robustness**: Implement more comprehensive error handling within the Puppeteer scraping process (e.g., handling network issues, element not found, CAPTCHAs).
4.  **Configuration Management**: Consider using environment variables or a separate configuration file for app IDs/URLs, Telegram token, and chat ID, instead of hardcoding them.
5.  **Testing**: Thoroughly test the entire flow, including scraping, message formatting, and Telegram delivery.
6.  **Deployment**: Outline steps for deploying the application (e.g., Docker).

## Challenges/Notes

- **Dynamic Content**: Scraping dynamic content is inherently fragile. Changes to the app store page layouts will break the scraper.
- **Rate Limiting/Blocking**: Frequent scraping might lead to IP blocking or rate limiting from app stores. Strategies like proxies or delays might be needed.
- **App Store APIs**: While Puppeteer is used for dynamic content, investigating official or unofficial app store APIs for ranking data might be more robust in the long term.
